# edge-service

This acts as a proxy for the ui-service. The goal is to work around CORS and the Same Origin Policy restriction of the browser and allow the UI to call the API even though they donâ€™t share the same origin. It also modifies the API response as ui-service needed. Edge-servicein has been used in the UI application to proxy calls to the REST API. 
Edge-service is based on Spring Cloud's zuul proxy which runs on a separate docker container .
